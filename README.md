# Cats-Company-Vulnerabilities (Fictional)
A vulnerability assessment scan was conducted and analysed. A vulnerability assessment report was created for the executive team which includes detailed scan results, methodology, findings, risk assessment and prioritized recommendations.

Cat needs help providing critical information to the executive team to help them make decisions and preparations that uphold the security of the organization.

Cat has requested a vulnerability assessment scan and collect all the information to prioritize the vulnerabilities that were found from highest risk to lowest, and determine what information would be necessary for the executive team to make decisions and preparations to have them mitigated.

Cat wants to make sure the executive team has all the information they need, but she knows that they donâ€™t have a lot of time. She has asked to write a vulnerability assessment report that explains the issues found, what is affected, what it might mean to the business, and what suggestions are recommend to fix the issues.
