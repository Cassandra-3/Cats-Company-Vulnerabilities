# Cats-Company-Vulnerabilities (Fictional)

*This project is part of my Cybersecurity bootcamp. 
The focus of this project is to:*
*- Conduct a vulnerability assessment scan and analyze results.*
*- Complete thorough research of discovered vulnerabilities and document all contributing factors in order to give decision makers as much information as possible for deciding what to mitigate, and in what order.*
*- Prepare a written report for business executive consumption and understanding.*

A vulnerability assessment scan was conducted and analysed for Cat's Company. A vulnerability assessment report was created for the executive team which includes detailed scan results, methodology, findings, risk assessment and prioritized recommendations.

Cat needs help providing critical information to the executive team to help them make decisions and preparations that uphold the security of the organization.

Cat has requested a vulnerability assessment scan and collect all the information to prioritize the vulnerabilities that were found from highest risk to lowest, and determine what information would be necessary for the executive team to make decisions and preparations to have them mitigated.

Cat wants to make sure the executive team has all the information they need, but she knows that they donâ€™t have a lot of time. She has asked to write a vulnerability assessment report that explains the issues found, what is affected, what it might mean to the business, and what suggestions are recommend to fix the issues.

The report contains:
Executive summary: a short summarization of the assessment that was carried out and why, what results were found, and an overview of the end recommendations proposed.
Scan results: detailed explanation of the results gotten from the scan, how the results have been categorized, and how the vulnerabilities are ordered.
Methodology: tools and tests used, purposes for each scan, tool, and test, and what environment each tool was used in.
Findings: what systems were scanned successfully or not and why.
Risk assessment: index of all vulnerabilities found, categorized Critical, High, Medium, or Low severity, explanations of risk categories, list of all vulnerabilities with details on vulnerable target/service/software etc., description, solution, and how many affected.
Recommendations: full list of actions that should be taken in prioritized order with explanations on why you recommend the order you do, recommendations on security policies, and configurations.
Results from OpenVAS vulnerability scan with details on how the scan was completed
Evidence of the use of industry standard frameworks and databases (e.g. NIST and MITRE) when discussing details about the vulnerabilities, how they have been prioritized, and how they should be remediated.
